##  What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that lets you package applications with all dependencies into **containers** so they run the same everywhere.

##  Key Concepts

### **Container**
A lightweight, isolated environment where your application runs.

### **Image**
A read only template used to create containers.

### **Dockerfile**
A file with instructions used to build a Docker image.

### **Docker Engine**
The runtime that builds and runs containers.

### **Registry**
A storage/server for images (e.g., Docker Hub).
