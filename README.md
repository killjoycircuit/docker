- Docker is a platform that lets you build, package, and run applications in isolated environments called containers
- Containers ensure your app runs the same everywhere on any system or cloud
- Docker Engine  → runs → Docker Image  → becomes → Container
- We run Docker images using the Docker Engine to create containers
